% RDFT - restricted domain Fourier Transform for Matlab/Octave

% A typical situation when RDFT is usefull is when the 2D Discrete Fourier 
% Transform is evaluated many times at a limited number of fixed 
% frequencies on large sparse matrices (with same dimensions but with
% changing positions and number of non-zero elements).

% This program shows how to use RDFT
