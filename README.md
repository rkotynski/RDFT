# RDFT  restricted domain Fourier Transform for Matlab/Octave
(a Python version will be also includesd soon)

A typical situation when RDFT is usefull is when the 2D Discrete Fourier 
Transform is evaluated many times at a limited number of fixed 
frequencies on large sparse matrices (with same dimensions but with
changing positions and number of non-zero elements).
